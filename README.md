# SearcherAI 

This is the frontend for our platform that integrates an advanced AI-powered research paper search system, enabling users to find cutting-edge articles on any research topic. Once the papers are gathered, the system generates a detailed summary with complete references.

Additionally, it features a real-time collaborative LaTeX editor, allowing multiple users to work on the same document simultaneously with instant synchronization and efficient change tracking.

The goal is to streamline the research, summarization, and academic writing process, providing an all-in-one tool for researchers, academics, and students.
